# Warehouse-Performance-Indicators

At first I created a fictive dataset of possible warehouse performance indicators. This dataset includes:
- Area of the warehouse,
- workplace definition in the area,
- amount of orders picked per day at a specific workplace,
- amount of order picking errors per day at a specific workplace,
- article names,
- hours the workplace run,
- hours the workplace didn't run due to maintenance,
- date,
- shift,
- if the workplace type is an	ergonomic or non-ergonomic

Course of events:
- loading the textfile and creating the dataset
- Exploratory data analysis
- Data wrangling, tyding and manipulation
- Visualizing data science findings


The code of the program and the dataset are in the folder "code"
The plots created in the program can seperately be found in the folder "plots"
