# Warehouse-Performance-Indicators

At first I created a fictive dataset of possible warehouse performance indicators. This dataset includes:
- Area of the warehouse,
- workplace definition in the area,
- amount of orders picked per day at a specific workplace,
- amount of order picking errors per day at a specific workplace,
- article names,
- hours the workplace run,
- hours the workplace didn't run due to maintenance,
- date,
- shift,
- if the workplace type is an	ergonomic or non-ergonomic

Course of events:
- loading the textfile and creating the dataset
- Exploratory data analysis
- Data wrangling, tyding and manipulation
- Visualizing data science findings
